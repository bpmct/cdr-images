      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
         use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
         where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
         meet the following conditions:

         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
             Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
             stating that You changed the files; and

         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

      APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

         To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following

         replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
         the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
         comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
         file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
         same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
         identification within third-party archives.

         "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
         the copyright owner that is granting the License.

         "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
         other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
         control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
         "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
         direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
         otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
         outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

         "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
         exercising permissions granted by this License.

         "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
         including but not limited to software source code, documentation
         source, and configuration files.

         "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
         transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
         not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
         and conversions to other media types.

         "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
         Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
         copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
         (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
         represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
         separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
         the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
         to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
         submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner

         communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
         and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
         Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
         excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
         designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

         "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
         on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
         subsequently incorporated within the Work.

      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
         use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
         where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
         meet the following conditions:

         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
             Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
             stating that You changed the files; and

         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

            To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
            boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"

            the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
            comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
            file or class name and description of purpose be included on the

      License

      THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS
      PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR
      OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS
      LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

      BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
      BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED
      HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

      1. Definitions

          "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or
          encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along
          with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent
          works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that
          constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as
          defined below) for the purposes of this License.
          "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and
          other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement,
          dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording,
          art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the
          Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that
          constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for
          the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a
          musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in
          timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a
          Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.
          "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the
          terms of this License.
          "Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.
          "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of
          this License.
          "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who
          has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the
          Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise
          rights under this License despite a previous violation.

      2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or
      restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on
      the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
      applicable laws.

      3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
      hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
      duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work
      as stated below:

          to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective
          Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;
          to create and reproduce Derivative Works;
          to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly,
          and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work
          including as incorporated in Collective Works;
          to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly,
          and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative
          Works.

          For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:
              Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the
              exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance
              rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public
              performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.
              Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive
              right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or
              designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord
              You create from the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to
              the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright
              Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
          Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where
          the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to
          collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g.
          SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast)
          of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114
          of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).

      The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
      hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
      as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats.
      All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

      4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject
      to and limited by the following restrictions:

          You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
          digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You
          must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License
          with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display,
          publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose
          any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or
          the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not
          sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this
          License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute,
          publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work
          with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a
          manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above
          applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not
          require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to
          the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from
          any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective
          Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), as requested. If You create a
          Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
          practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by
          clause 4(b), as requested.
          If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
          perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep
          intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the
          medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or
          pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author
          and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor
          institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution in Licensor's
          copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of
          such party or parties; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent
          reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that
          Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
          refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in
          the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in
          the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original
          Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). Such
          credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that
          in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such
          credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and
          in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship
          credit.

      5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

      UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
      THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING
      THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
      LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
      PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
      OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME
      JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH
      EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

      6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN
      NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
      INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
      LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
      POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

      7. Termination

          This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
          upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities
          who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this
          License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such
          individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.
          Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
          Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
          perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
          Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
          under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
          provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this
          License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
          under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full
          force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

      8. Miscellaneous

          Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a
          Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work
          on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this
          License.
          Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work,
          Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same
          terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
          If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
          applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
          remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
          parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
          extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
          No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

         submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
         or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
         the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
         means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
         to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
         communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
         and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
         Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
         excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
         designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

         "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
         on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
         subsequently incorporated within the Work.

      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
         use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
         where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
         meet the following conditions:

         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
             Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
             stating that You changed the files; and

         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any
            Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,
            support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and
            You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor
            for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as
            a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

            3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.
            You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the
            terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice,
            which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are
            in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
            Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient.s rights
            in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If You
            distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different
            license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
            from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer
            or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and
            every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or
            such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

            3.6. Larger Works.
            You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code
            not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work
            as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements
            of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.

      4. Versions of the License.

            4.1. New Versions.
            Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish
            revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each
            version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided
            in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to
            modify this License.

            4.2. Effect of New Versions.
            You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
            Software available under the terms of the version of the License under
            which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial
            Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from
            being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version
            of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software
            available under the terms of the version of the License under which You
            originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose
            to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under
            the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the
            license steward.

            4.3. Modified Versions.
            When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for
            Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this
            License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the
            name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from
            this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains
            terms which differ from this License.

      5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

         COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN .AS IS. BASIS, WITHOUT
         WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
         LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
         MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK
         AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD
         ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL
         DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY
         SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
         ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED
         HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

      6. TERMINATION.

            6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
            automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
            such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions
            which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of
            this License shall survive.

            6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory
            judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial
            Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to
            as .Participant.) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the
            Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original
            Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or
            indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly
            or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the
            Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under
            Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from
            Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of
            such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You
            withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such
            Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with
            Participant.

            6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end
            user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor
            hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any
            distributor) shall survive termination.

      7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

         UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
         NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY
         OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF
         ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
         INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
         LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE,
         COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR
         LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
         SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR
         DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY.S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT
         APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
         EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS
         EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

      8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

         The Covered Software is a .commercial item,. as that term is defined in 48
         C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of .commercial computer software. (as
         that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. ? 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and .commercial
         computer software documentation. as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212
         (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1
         through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered
         Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights
         clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or
         provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this
         License.

      9. MISCELLANEOUS.

         This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
         hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
         provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
         enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction
         specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the
         extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such
         jurisdiction.s conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this
         License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the
         jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original
         Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without
         limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys. fees and expenses. The
         application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
         International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation
         which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the
         drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are
         responsible for compliance with the United States export administration
         regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other
         countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered
         Software.

      10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

         As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible
         for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its
         utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial
         Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable
         basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any
         admission of liability.

         NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION
         LICENSE (CDDL)

         The code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of the State
         of California (excluding conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating
         to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of
         the Northern District of California and the state courts of the State of
         California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.


      The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991


      Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59 Temple Place, Suite
      330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA

      Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
      document, but changing it is not allowed.

      Preamble

      The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
      and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to
      guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
      software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most
      of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose
      authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is
      covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
      your programs, too.

      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
      General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
      distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
      that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
      the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can
      do these things.

      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny
      you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions
      translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
      software, or if you modify it.

      For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a
      fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make
      sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them
      these terms so they know their rights.

      We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer
      you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or
      modify the software.

      Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
      everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the
      software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
      know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by
      others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

      Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish
      to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually
      obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent
      this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free
      use or not licensed at all.

      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
      follow.


      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

      0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
      placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of
      this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or
      work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
      derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
      Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
      translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without
      limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".

      Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
      this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not
      restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents
      constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by
      running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

      1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as
      you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately
      publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;
      keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
      warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
      along with the Program.

      You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at
      your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

      2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus
      forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications
      or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
      these conditions:

         a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
         you changed the files and the date of any change.

         b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or
         in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be
         licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this
         License.

         c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,
         you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most
         ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate
         copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that
         you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
         these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
         (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print
         such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print
         an announcement.)

      These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
      sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably
      considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and
      its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
      works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
      work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
      this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole,
      and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

      Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
      rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
      right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the
      Program.

      In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the
      Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
      distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
      License.

      3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section
      2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
      provided that you also do one of the following:

         a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,
         which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
         medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

         b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give
         any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing
         source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding
         source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
         medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

         c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
         distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for
         noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object
         code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b
         above.)

      The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
      modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the
      source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
      definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation
      of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed
      need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or
      binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
      operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself
      accompanies the executable.

      If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy
      from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code
      from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third
      parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

      4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
      expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
      sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate
      your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or
      rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
      long as such parties remain in full compliance.

      5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
      However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program
      or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not
      accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any
      work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do
      so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
      Program or works based on it.

      6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),
      the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
      copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.
      You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the
      rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third
      parties to this License.

      7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement
      or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed
      on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the
      conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
      License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your
      obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a
      consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent
      license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those
      who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
      could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
      distribution of the Program.

      If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
      particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the
      section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

      It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
      other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
      section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
      distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many
      people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
      distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
      system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
      distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
      choice.

      This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
      consequence of the rest of this License.

      8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
      countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright
      holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit
      geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
      distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such
      case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this
      License.

      9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
      General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in
      spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems
      or concerns.

      Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies
      a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version",
      you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version
      or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the
      Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any
      version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

      10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
      whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
      permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,
      write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.
      Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
      all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of
      software generally.

      NO WARRANTY

      11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE
      PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED
      IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS
      IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
      NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
      PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
      ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

      12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
      ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
      PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
      SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY
      TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
      RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
      THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER
      PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS


      How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

      If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use
      to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which
      everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

      To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach
      them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion
      of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a
      pointer to where the full notice is found.

         One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.

         Copyright (C)

         This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under
         the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software
         Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later
         version.

         This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
         ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS
         FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more
         details.

         You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with
         this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple
         Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA

      Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

      If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it
      starts in an interactive mode:

         Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
         Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
         This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain
         conditions; type `show c' for details.

      The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
      parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be
      called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
      mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

      You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
      if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is
      a sample; alter the names:

         Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
         `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

         signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989

      This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
      proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider
      it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If
      this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License instead
      of this License.


      "CLASSPATH" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL VERSION 2

      Certain source files distributed by Sun Microsystems, Inc. are subject to the
      following clarification and special exception to the GPL Version 2, but only
      where Sun has expressly included in the particular source file's header the
      words

      "Sun designates this particular file as subject to the "Classpath" exception as
      provided by Sun in the License file that accompanied this code."

      Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making a
      combined work based on this library. Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU
      General Public License Version 2 cover the whole combination.

      As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
      permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
      executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and to
      copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your choice,
      provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and
      conditions of the license of that module.? An independent module is a module
      which is not derived from or based on this library.? If you modify this library,
      you may extend this exception to your version of the library, but you are not
      obligated to do so.? If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception

      3. Distribution Obligations.

      3.1. Availability of Source Code.

      Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in
      Executable form must also be made available in
      Source Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the
      terms of this License. You must include a
      copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered
      Software You distribute or otherwise make
      available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable
      form as to how they can obtain such
      Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or through a
      medium customarily used for software
      exchange.

      3.2. Modifications.

      The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the
      terms of this License. You represent
      that You believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You
      have sufficient rights to grant the rights
      conveyed by this License.

      3.3. Required Notices.

      You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as
      the Contributor of the Modification. You
      may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained
      within the Covered Software, or any
      notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any
      Contributor or the Initial Developer.

      3.4. Application of Additional Terms.

      You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code
      form that alters or restricts the
      applicable version of this License or the recipients’ rights hereunder. You may
      choose to offer, and to charge a fee
      for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more
      recipients of Covered Software. However, you
      may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or
      any Contributor. You must make it
      absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability
      obligation is offered by You alone, and You
      hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
      liability incurred by the Initial
      Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or
      liability terms You offer.

      3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.

      You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms
      of this License or under the terms of a
      license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
      provided that You are in compliance with
      the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form does not
      attempt to limit or alter the
      recipient’s rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this
      License. If You distribute the Covered
      Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make it
      absolutely clear that any terms which differ
      from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or
      Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify
      the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
      Initial Developer or such Contributor as
      a result of any such terms You offer.

      3.6. Larger Works.

      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not
      governed by the terms of this License
      and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must
      make sure the requirements of this License
      are fulfilled for the Covered Software.

      4. Versions of the License.

      4.1. New Versions.

      Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish revised
      and/or new versions of this License from
      time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except
      as provided in Section 4.3, no one
      other than the license steward has the right to modify this License.

      4.2. Effect of New Versions.

      You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
      Software available under the terms of the
      version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software.
      If the Initial Developer includes a
      notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or
      otherwise made available under any subsequent
      version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software
      available under the terms of the version of
      the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise,
      You may also choose to use, distribute
      or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any
      subsequent version of the License published by
      the license steward.

      4.3. Modified Versions.

      When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your
      Original Software, You may create and
      use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove
      any references to the name of the
      license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License); and
      (b) otherwise make it clear that the
      license contains terms which differ from this License.

      5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

      COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT
      WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
      IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS
      FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR
      A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
      PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS
      WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT
      THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER
      CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
      THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES
      AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED
      HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

      6. TERMINATION.

      6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
      if You fail to comply with terms herein
      and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
      Provisions which, by their nature, must
      remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

      6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment
      actions) against Initial Developer or a
      Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such
      claim is referred to as “Participant”)
      alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where
      the Participant is a Contributor or the
      Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or
      indirectly infringes any patent, then any
      and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the
      Initial Developer (if the Initial
      Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or
      2.2 of this License shall, upon 60
      days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the
      expiration of such 60 day notice period,
      unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the
      Participant Software against such
      Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with
      Participant.

      6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user
      licenses that have been validly granted
      by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses
      granted to You by any distributor) shall
      survive termination.

      7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

      UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
      NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL
      YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED
      SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF
      SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
      CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER
      INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK
      STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
      MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH
      PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE
      POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO
      LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
      RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY’S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS
      SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
      NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
      THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT
      APPLY TO YOU.

      8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

      The Covered Software is a “commercial item,” as that term is defined in 48
      C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of
      “commercial computer software” (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. §
      252.227-7014(a)(1)) and “commercial computer
      software documentation” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995).
      Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and
      48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End
      Users acquire Covered Software with only
      those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of,
      and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR,
      or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer
      software under this License.

      9. MISCELLANEOUS.

      This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof.
      If any provision of this License is
      held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
      necessary to make it enforceable. This
      License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice
      contained within the Original Software
      (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding
      such jurisdiction’s conflict-of-law
      provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the
      jurisdiction of the courts located in the
      jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original
      Software, with the losing party responsible
      for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys’
      fees and expenses. The application of
      the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods
      is expressly excluded. Any law or
      regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed
      against the drafter shall not apply to
      this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the
      United States export administration
      regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries)
      when You use, distribute or otherwise
      make available any Covered Software.

      10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

      As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for
      claims and damages arising, directly
      or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree
      to work with Initial Developer and
      Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing
      herein is intended or shall be deemed to
      constitute any admission of liability.

      2. License Grants.

      2.1. The Initial Developer Grant.
      Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section 3.1 below and subject to third
      party intellectual property claims, the
      Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive
      license:
      (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
      Licensable by Initial Developer, to use,
      reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original
      Software (or portions thereof), with or
      without Modifications, and/or as part of a Larger Work; and
      (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using or selling of Original
      Software, to make, have made, use,
      practice, sell, and offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the Original
      Software (or portions thereof).
      (c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.1(a) and (b) are effective on the date
      Initial Developer first distributes or
      otherwise makes the Original Software available to a third party under the terms
      of this License.
      (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted: (1) for
      code that You delete from the Original
      Software, or (2) for infringements caused by: (i) the modification of the
      Original Software, or (ii) the combination of
      the Original Software with other software or devices.
      2.2. Contributor Grant.
      Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section 3.1 below and subject to third
      party intellectual property claims, each
      Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:
      (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
      Licensable by Contributor to use, reproduce,

      Software and/or as part of a Larger Work;
      and
      (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling of
      Modifications made by that Contributor either
      alone and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions of such
      combination), to make, use, sell, offer
      for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of: (1) Modifications made by that

      Contributor Version (or portions of such
      combination).
      (c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective on the date
      Contributor first distributes or

      software (except as part of the Contributor
      Version) or other devices; or (3) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered
      Software in the absence of Modifications
      made by that Contributor.
      3. Distribution Obligations.

      3.1. Availability of Source Code.
      Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in
      Executable form must also be made available in
      Source Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the
      terms of this License. You must include a
      copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered
      Software You distribute or otherwise make
      available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable
      form as to how they can obtain such
      Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or through a
      medium customarily used for software
      exchange.
      3.2. Modifications.
      The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the
      terms of this License. You represent
      that You believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You
      have sufficient rights to grant the rights
      conveyed by this License.
      3.3. Required Notices.
      You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as
      the Contributor of the Modification. You
      may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained
      within the Covered Software, or any
      notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any
      Contributor or the Initial Developer.
      3.4. Application of Additional Terms.
      You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code
      form that alters or restricts the
      applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may
      choose to offer, and to charge a fee
      for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more
      recipients of Covered Software. However, you
      may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or
      any Contributor. You must make it
      absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability
      obligation is offered by You alone, and You
      hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
      liability incurred by the Initial
      Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or
      liability terms You offer.
      3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.
      You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms
      of this License or under the terms of a
      license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
      provided that You are in compliance with
      the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form does not
      attempt to limit or alter the
      recipient's rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this
      License. If You distribute the Covered
      Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make it
      absolutely clear that any terms which differ
      from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or
      Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify
      the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
      Initial Developer or such Contributor as
      a result of any such terms You offer.
      3.6. Larger Works.
      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not
      governed by the terms of this License
      and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must
      make sure the requirements of this License
      are fulfilled for the Covered Software.
      4. Versions of the License.

      4.1. New Versions.
      Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new
      versions of this License from time to time.
      Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided
      in Section 4.3, no one other than the
      license steward has the right to modify this License.
      4.2. Effect of New Versions.
      You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
      Software available under the terms of the
      version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software.
      If the Initial Developer includes a
      notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or
      otherwise made available under any subsequent
      version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software
      available under the terms of the version of
      the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise,
      You may also choose to use, distribute
      or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any
      subsequent version of the License published by
      the license steward.
      4.3. Modified Versions.
      When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your
      Original Software, You may create and
      use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove
      any references to the name of the
      license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License); and
      (b) otherwise make it clear that the
      license contains terms which differ from this License.
      5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

      COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT
      WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
      IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS
      FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR
      A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
      PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS
      WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT
      THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER
      CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
      THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES
      AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED
      HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

      6. TERMINATION.

      6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
      if You fail to comply with terms herein
      and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
      Provisions which, by their nature, must
      remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.
      6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment
      actions) against Initial Developer or a
      Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such
      claim is referred to as “Participant”)
      alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where
      the Participant is a Contributor or the
      Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or
      indirectly infringes any patent, then any
      and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the
      Initial Developer (if the Initial
      Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or
      2.2 of this License shall, upon 60
      days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the
      expiration of such 60 day notice period,
      unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the
      Participant Software against such
      Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with
      Participant.
      6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that
      the Participant Software directly or
      indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license
      or settlement) prior to the initiation
      of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
      granted by such Participant under Sections
      2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any
      payment or license.
      6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user
      licenses that have been validly granted
      by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses
      granted to You by any distributor) shall
      survive termination.
      7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

      UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
      NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL
      YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED
      SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF
      SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
      CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER
      INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE,
      COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND
      ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
      INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
      THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
      INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S
      NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME
      JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
      LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND
      LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

      8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

      The Covered Software is a “commercial item,” as that term is defined in 48
      C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of
      “commercial computer software” (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. §
      252.227-7014(a)(1)) and “commercial computer
      software documentation” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995).
      Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and
      48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End
      Users acquire Covered Software with only
      those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of,
      and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR,
      or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer
      software under this License.

      9. MISCELLANEOUS.

      This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof.
      If any provision of this License is
      held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
      necessary to make it enforceable. This
      License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice
      contained within the Original Software
      (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding
      such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law
      provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the
      jurisdiction of the courts located in the
      jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original
      Software, with the losing party responsible
      for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys'
      fees and expenses. The application of
      the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods
      is expressly excluded. Any law or
      regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed
      against the drafter shall not apply to
      this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the
      United States export administration
      regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries)
      when You use, distribute or otherwise
      make available any Covered Software.

      10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

      As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for
      claims and damages arising, directly
      or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree
      to work with Initial Developer and
      Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing
      herein is intended or shall be deemed to
      constitute any admission of liability.

      NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE
      (CDDL)

      The code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of the State of
      California (excluding conflict-of-law
      provisions). Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the
      jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the
      Northern District of California and the state courts of the State of California,
      with venue lying in Santa Clara
      County, California.

       source, and configuration files.

       "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
       transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
       not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
       and conversions to other media types.

       "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
       Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
       copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
       (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

       "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

       "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
       the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
       to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

       or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
       the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

       excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
       designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

       "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
       on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
       subsequently incorporated within the Work.

    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
       Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
       as of the date such litigation is filed.

    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
       meet the following conditions:

       (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

       (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
           stating that You changed the files; and

       (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
           the Derivative Works; and

       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
           as modifying the License.

       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
       the conditions stated in this License.

    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

    APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

      1. Definitions.

         "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
         and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

         "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
         the copyright owner that is granting the License.

         "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
         other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
         control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
         "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
         direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
         otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
         outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

         "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
         exercising permissions granted by this License.

         "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
         including but not limited to software source code, documentation
         source, and configuration files.

         "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
         transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
         not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
         and conversions to other media types.

         "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
         Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
         copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
         (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
         represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
         separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
         the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
         to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
         submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
         or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
         the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
         means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
         to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
         communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
         and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
         Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
         excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
         designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

         "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
         on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
         subsequently incorporated within the Work.

      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
         use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
         where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
         meet the following conditions:

         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
             Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
             stating that You changed the files; and

         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
